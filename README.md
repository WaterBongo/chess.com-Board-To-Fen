# Chess.com Board Recognizer

Uses a convolutional neural network to recognize the positions of pieces and translate it into FEN format.

If you have an image of a chess.com board as chessboard.png

![Example ChessBoard](./readme/chessboard.png)

Run recognizer.py

`python3 recognizer.py chessboard.png`

The Computer will return a link to view the board, accuracy and the FEN format

`Confidence: 99.53%`

## Sample results

### Randomly generated 32 piece game

![example1](./readme/example1.png)

Predicted `2r5/PP1K1b1Q/2N1B1n1/1pkPpppp/Rp1b2P1/2PPR1N1/1PpP3p/1qr3Bn`

Confidence `97.75%`

Accuracy `100%`

### Randomly generated 16 piece game

![example2](./readme/example2.png)

Predicted `8/p1P5/6q1/B1K2B2/P1P1p3/1PQ5/1r4pk/n3N3`

Confidence `99.82%`

Accuracy `100%`

## Getting Started

To use the chessboard recognizer, you will need **ATLEAST** [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) And [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

Set up your enviroment, and then install all required packages

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

To use the recognizer, you will need to have a neural network model.

Lucky For you, I've already provided one inside of the folder `nn`

Once you have everything setup, run `recognize.py` with the path of the image you want to identify

`python3 recognize.py chessboard.png`
